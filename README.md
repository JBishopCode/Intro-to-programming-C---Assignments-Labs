In this assignment we were tasked to write a program that plays 3D bingo on a 5x5x5 board. 

The program reads a 3D board of 125 numbers (five 5x5 layers). Only the exact middle cell is 0 (the free cell); all other values follow Bingo colum ranges. 
(B=1–15, I=16–30, N=31–45, G=46–60, O=61–75)

Then the program reads called numbers, marks matches, shows the board after each call, and stops when theres a winning line. 

To run the code, use the  ThreeDBingo.exe file and provide the input(board + called numbers)

For example, "board.txt | .\ThreeDBingo.exe"
